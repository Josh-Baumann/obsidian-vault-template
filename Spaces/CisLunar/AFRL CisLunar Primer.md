- Moon is ~9x further away from Earth than GEO
- USSF responsibility from GEO -> CisLunar = 1000x servicable volume
- CisLunar orbit differences from classical orbital mechanics:
	- Trajectory is no longer conics - circle, ellipse, etc
	- Trajectory is no longer planar
	- Trajectory is no longer easily geometrically described
	- **TLE's are no longer useful**
- Lagrange points, Halo orbits, Lyapunov orbits
	- Infinitely repeating orbits, but are unstable and need to be mainted with small stationkeeping maneuvers
	- Considered **chaotic**: due to instabilities, small deviations from planned orbits propagate into large position and velocity errors

## Further Information on Referenced Orbit Types

- Lagrange points
	- 5 points for a 3-body system
	- L1, L2, and L3 are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies
	- L4 and L5 each act as the third vertex of an equalateral triangle formed with the centers of the two large bodies.
- Halo orbits
	- A halo orbit is a periodic, three-dimensional orbit near one of the L1, L2 or L3 Lagrange points in the three-body problem of orbital mechanics.
- Lyapunov orbits
	- Periodic orbit near L3, L4, L5
